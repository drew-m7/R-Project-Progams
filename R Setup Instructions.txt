Click on the three dots in the top right of the files screen then navigate to the programs directory. 
Next, click on the More button with the gear next to it to open a dropdown menu. Select “Set As Working Directory” and you should be able to run the programs without problem.

Program 4 will require you to install some packages before running it. Just follow the instructions in the alert message at the top of the window. 
You may need to run the program a couple of times and restart R studio for the packages to fully install.
